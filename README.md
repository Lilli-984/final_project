# final_project

My project is a user-input-focused program that privides multiple choice and open ended input options. The main attraction is the input scanner for most questions that allow you to continue trying an input until it is valid. 

The only module that was used in my program was the re module that was used for the regex that scanned the inputs.

In order to use my program you can just copy and paste the program into VSC without any other outside installments.
